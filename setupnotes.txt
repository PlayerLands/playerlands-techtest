My setup notes

Forked the repo and created my branch 'jpflood'.
Setup dotnet project and run.
I needed node installing as I hadn't set it up yet on my laptop.
npm installed and did audit fix.
Getting linebreak/extensions/no-unresolved import eslint issues. Ignored locally for now but long 
term I need get something global and neatly set up.
Crash course in vue development.
Created solution file for testapi itself and used VS2019 for API development as its currently a better IDE than VSCode and added unit tests.
Normally I'd create integration tests for the API but as we have UI tests I haven't done this.
The design of the api (injected dependencies, separations, interfaces, responsibilties etc) and test coverage is typical of what I would produce. 
Along with coverage of the UI with tests.
Note there is no logging right now but I would normally enable it to capture issues.
